# Yoshida_lab1
For this project we were given a data set containing information on carbon emissions in different countries. Using python and various code libraries we will be analysing this data to get more detailed information.
The data set that we will be using was downloaded from owid on github. https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-data.csv
