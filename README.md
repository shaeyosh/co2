# Shae Yoshida lab 1:Co2emissions
For this project we were given a data set containing information on carbon emissions in different countries. Using python and various code libraries we will be analysing this data to get more detailed information.
The data set that we will be using was downloaded from ourworld on github on march 29th, 2023. https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-data.csv

The purpose of this project was to analyze CO2 emission data for various countries over a span of years. In order to complete this task I utilized the Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy Libraries. These libraries allowed me to run code to obtain information such as numerical summary values as well as allowing me to produce graphs and plots which I can draw conclusions from. Overall, after completing all of the required analysis proccesses, I found that CO2 emission trends are increasing as time goes on across all considered countries.
